# Country Comparison - Data Analysis

This project performs data analysis on a dataset comparing various countries across different metrics. The analysis includes inspecting country-specific data, visualizing trends, and deriving insights based on the data provided.

## Features

- **Dataset Overview**: Load and explore a large dataset containing country-related metrics.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing data, check for inconsistencies, and clean the dataset.
- **Unique Country Analysis**: Identify and analyze the countries in the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Generate charts and graphs to compare countries on different parameters.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is called **`country_comparison_large_dataset.csv`**. It contains a wide range of information about countries, including economic, health, education, and other metrics. The dataset allows for an in-depth comparison across countries based on multiple parameters.

## Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Loading the Data**: The dataset is loaded using `pandas` to perform basic data exploration.
2. **Data Inspection**: Inspect the data for completeness, check for missing values, and identify data types.
3. **Country-Specific Analysis**: The number of unique countries in the dataset is determined to better understand the global representation.
4. **Visualization**: Generate visualizations like bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots to compare countries across various features.
